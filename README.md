# Call-Centre-Dashboard-Analysis
a call centre manager asks for a clear insights for the data of his team. and she asked some key performance regarding each agent of his team like total number of calls,
answered calls, abandoned calls, speed of answer and call duration.
the dataset contains one sheet with 10 columns and 5000 rows.
the dataset was prepared for analysis, have done some modifications of the data like data tpe validating, transforming the AvgTalkDuration column into seconds and
modifing the time column
the data set was then uploaded to Power BI for analysis and visualizations.
I have concluded some key performance for the team. (calls per agent, answred calls per agent, abandoned/answered calls rate, resolved calls % for each agent, avg speed
of answer, avg duration calls, satisfaction rate per aegent, the amount of calls during month day and day hour to identify the rush hour and rush days (it's funny that 11
of each month has the most calls) and also the calls for each topic.
